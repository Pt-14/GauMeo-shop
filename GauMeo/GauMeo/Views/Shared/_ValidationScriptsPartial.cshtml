@* 
    This file contains client-side validation scripts for ASP.NET Core.
    Currently validation libraries are not installed, so this is empty.
    You can install jquery-validation and jquery-validation-unobtrusive 
    via LibMan or npm to enable client-side validation.
*@

@* When validation libraries are available, uncomment these lines:
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>
